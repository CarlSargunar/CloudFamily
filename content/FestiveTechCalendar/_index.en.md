### **What is it?**

The Festive Tech Calendar is a month long **FUN** tech event where we look for people from all communities to take part in a fun 
and engaging session which is a bit different to your normal conference - we really would like to express that its **fun**. 


Last year we had some amazing content:- 

- Hackathons
- Twitch Streams
- Christmas Quiz

### **When is it?**
The Festive Tech Calendar runs throughout the entire month of December, its a community event spanning all communities and we would love to have **You** take part this year.
In previous years everyone who submitted content has been accepted and taken part and we hope to do this each and every year.

During this years event we want to raise some money for some charities - more on that soon.

---

### **Get Involved**
The Call for Content will be opening very soon - keep your eyes open for the announcements on twitter and LinkedIn.

---

### **Charities**
We are working behind the scenes thinking about which charities we can try and raise money for during the Festive Tech Calendar.


---

### **Become a Supporter**
This year we would love to be able to have some competitions and giveaways, we arent calling it a supporter rather than a sponsor as we are 
looking to see if any companies would like to give some prizes away and run competitions etc during the Festive Tech Calendar.
As a supporter we would be giving you lots of mentions, retweets and shout out's for being a lovely supporter of our event and the 
community in general.
