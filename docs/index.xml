      <description>This page is a shameful copy of the great Grav original page. Only difference is information about image customization (resizing, add CSS classes&amp;hellip;)
Let&amp;rsquo;s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages.
Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it.</description>

      <description>We should be careful about the references we include in the sitemap xml file, to avoid a high volume of pages included in the sitemap and consequently being indexed to Search Engines such as Google, Bing and more. Especially because we should mind about keeping the most relevant content in the top of the search engine index.
Configuration Hugo by default indexes all pages to the sitemap.
The proposal is just to include a parameter to the pages we want to exclude from sitemap.</description>
